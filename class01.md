# Responsive 
Responsive web design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size.


### Responsive vs. Adaptive vs. Mobile
*Responsive* generally means to react quickly and positively to any change.
*Adaptive* means to be easily modified for a new purpose or situation, such as change.

**Flexible Layouts**
Responsive web design is broken down into three main components:
1. flexible layouts.
2. media queries.
3. flexible media.

*flexible layouts*
Website layouts need to adapt to this change and fixed values have too many constraints.

*media queries*
Media queries provide the ability to specify different styles for individual browser and device circumstances.

*flexible media*
equally important aspect to responsive web design involves flexible media. As viewports begin to change size media doesnâ€™t always follow suit. Images, videos, and other media types need to be scalable, changing their size as the size of the viewport changes.

# Float
Float is a CSS positioning property.

### float values:
1. Left
2. Right
3. None (the default) ensures the element will not float
4. Inherit which will assume the float value from that elements parent element.

### What are floats used for?
- floats can be used to create entire web layouts.
- Floats are helpful for layout in smaller instances. 

### Clearing the Float
clear: both;	// to clear the float

- Both is most commonly used, which clears floats coming from either direction. 
- Left and Right can be used to only clear the float from one direction respectively. 
- None is the default, which is typically unnecessary unless removing a clear value from a cascade.
