# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team


Our data-saturated age Enables us to examine our work habits and office quirks with a scrutiny that our cubicle-bound forebears could only dream of. 
on corporate campuses and within university laboratories, psychologists, sociologists and statisticians are devoting themselves to studying everything from team composition to email patterns in order to figure out how to make employees into faster, better and more productive versions of themselves.
Project Aristotle’s researchers Began by reviewing a half-century of academic studies looking at how teams worked. 

- Were the best teams made up of people with similar interests? 
- did it matter more whether everyone was motivated by the same kinds of rewards? 

Based on those studies, the researchers scrutinized the composition of groups inside Google: 
- How often did teammates socialize outside the office? Did they have the same hobbies? 
- Were their educational backgrounds similar? 
- Was it better for all teammates to be outgoing or for all of them to be shy? They drew diagrams showing which teams had overlapping memberships and which groups had exceeded their departments’ goals. 

They studied how long teams stuck together and if gender balance seemed to have an impact on a team’s success. 
The technology industry  is not just one of the fastest growing parts of our economy; it is also increasingly the world’s dominant commercial culture. 

# REST
### http : 
- That first part tells the browser what protocol to use. That stuff you type in there is one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing.
 - it is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web. You can think of it like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.

### The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”. 
**REST** provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to.

A web page is a “representation” of a resource. Resources are just concepts. URLs--those things that you type into the browser.
URLs tell the browser that there's a concept somewhere. A browser can then go ask for a specific representation of the concept. Specifically, the browser asks for the web page representation of the concept.

**resource has only a single representation.**

### How do the machines tell each other where things are?
If everything that machines need to talk about has a corresponding URL, you've created the machine equivalent of a noun.
