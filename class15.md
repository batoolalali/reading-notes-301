# Diversity and Inclusion

- Silicon Valley's gender gap is the result of computer-game marketing
The few women who do make it into the field are far less likely to stay than their male counterparts. 

- The Center for Talent Innovation, a research think tank, found that US women are 45% more likely than men to leave careers in technology.

- The research revealed that women often feel isolated due to a lack of female role models and the sense of being excluded from “buddy networks” among men. 

Though there are isolated examples of both vintage and contemporary computer advertising aimed at women, it is clear that the advertising narrative around women and technology needs to be more inclusive if the gender gap is going to close.
 Until that happens, as Ames argues, advertising will continue to drive “a subtle message to girls and women that it's not a place where they belong.”

## Why diversity matters to your tech company ?
- Diverse companies perform better
- Given that diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones, it is unsurprising that a wealth of research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes. 

Companies are losing out on great talent
Failing to attract and hire employees from underrepresented backgrounds leads companies to miss out on incredible talent.
Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base
When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups.
